These are key-points discussed from the book "Psychology of money" by Morgan Housel.

## The impact of luck and risk

Some religion describe luck as a positive destiny that was brought upon by past life's do goods. And bad luck is a form of punishment for wrong doings in the past life.
But a more general definition of luck I think we could all agree is that outcomes and consequences you cannot control or foresee whatsoever are just happen to be in your favor. Bad luck is the otherwise.
While personal actions and decisions matter, luck and risk play significant roles in our financial outcomes. Recognizing the influence of luck cultivates humility and guards against overconfidence. Additionally, understanding and managing risk is crucial for long-term financial stability. Diversification and avoiding large, irreversible mistakes can help mitigate the impact of unexpected events.


## Compounding
Building wealth is not about overnight success or chasing quick gains; it's about harnessing the power of compounding. By consistently saving and investing over time, even small amounts can grow exponentially. The key is to have patience and think long-term, allowing your money to work for you and accumulate wealth gradually. Most of Warren Buffet money are made after he's over 60. Disney almost went out of business before snow white. Success comes from executing consecutive horrible ideas. Ideas must acted upon. 


## Money is not just math 
Financial success is heavily influenced by our behaviors and mindset. Our emotions, biases, and tendencies impact our financial decisions more than we realize. Understanding our own behavioral patterns, such as our inclination to avoid losses or follow the crowd, can help us make better choices and avoid common financial pitfalls.


## Financial Security
Saving money and living below our means are essential for financial security. Regardless of income level, adopting a frugal mindset and being intentional about spending can create a solid financial foundation. Saving not only provides a safety net but also opens up opportunities for investment and wealth creation.


## Resilience afd Adaptability
Financial well-being requires resilience and adaptability. Being able to thrive in the face of adversity is crucial. Embracing uncertainty, learning from failures, and being flexible in our financial plans can help us navigate economic downturns and unexpected challenges. Building multiple income streams and having a diversified portfolio contribute to long-term resilience.


## The Value of Contentment
True wealth extends beyond monetary figures. It lies in finding contentment and satisfaction in non-financial aspects of life. Understanding our own values and aligning our financial goals accordingly can lead to a healthier and more balanced approach to money. Focusing on what truly brings us joy and fulfillment rather than constantly chasing more money can lead to a more satisfying life overall.


By embracing these key points, we can develop a more holistic and mindful approach to our finances, leading to greater financial well-being and long-term success.
